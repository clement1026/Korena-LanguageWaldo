 HITTING_FAN_DESC:0 "맞아, 그것은 오른쪽! 그것 우산 모음들은 다가오는것에 대해 사실 쓸모가 있다"
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "그럼에도 불구하고 통합된 왕국은 나타났습니다 대전쟁에서 승리를 거둔, 그 세워졌습니다 그것의 위대한 제국은 흔들어졌다 그것의 핵심애서. 그 국가의 경찰세대는 잃었습니다  3차원에서의 플랑드르 그리고 북부 프랑스, 불안함이 도처에 퍼지고 공동부유 그리고  거대한 빚이  누적될 동안\n\n신선한 기억의 마지막 전쟁과 함께, 그 국가는 이제 얼굴 그 다른 관점. 이것은 다가옵니다 증가되는 깨끗함 그것 우리시대의 평화는 없다. "
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "대전쟁의 참상에도 불구하고, 프랑스는 강건한 경제 덕택에 재건의 길을 걷고 있습니다. 하지만 대공황이 나라에 여전히 영향을 미치고 있고, 독일의 새 정권은 베르사유 조약에 명기되어 있는 전쟁 배상금을 내는 데 관심이 없습니다.\n\n조약이 체결되었을 때, 프랑스의 페르디낭 포슈 원수는 이 조약이 평화를 의미하는 것이 아닌 20년 간의 휴전 협정일 뿐이라는 유명한 말을 남겼습니다. 이제 그 20년이 다 되어 갑니다."
 GER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "독일은 이제 통일된 지 거의 10년이 되었습니다. 경제적으로 그 어느 때보다 강력하지만, 미래의 불경기 전망과 함께, 독일은 이 세계에서 새로운 목표를 찾아야 합니다. 새로 독립한 동유럽 국가들은 독일이 상당한 영향력을 가지고 있는 유럽 연합에 가입하려 하고 있습니다. 독일은 어두운 과거 때문에 어려움을 겪고 있지만 밝은 미래를 바라보고 있습니다."
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "떠오르는 파시즘과 함께, 이탈리아는 들어갔다 새로운 영광의 시대. 그들의 강제적인 현재로 에티오피아를 자라는 이탈리아의 식민적인 제국에 더하는 절차, 하지만 무솔리니의 야망은 거기서 멈추지 않는다.\n\n 자치령을 너머 지중해 국가들은 항상 이탈리아의 운명이였습니다, 그리고 그 TNO는 소지품의 모양을 훔쳐갔습니다 유럽에서. 조수의 파도가 바뀌는것이 찾아올때, 이탈리아는 그들의 산마루 혹은 쓸려가버린 위험에서 장소를 찾을것입니다."
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "일본 제국은 십자가도로 위에 서있습니다. 호쿠신론, 북부 확장 이론은 군대에 의해 선호받고 또한 시베리아의 진보를 촉구합니다. 난신론, 남부 확장 정책은 검남색과 동남아시아와 태평양을 타겟으로한 부유한 유럽인 집단에 의해 지지를 얻습니다.\n\n그런 다음, 당연합니다, 중국이 항상 있다. 일본은 붙잡는다 무서운 군인들, 하지만 그들의 산업들은 자원을 향해 굼주린다. 그리고 이제 시간이 소진되었습니다. 그러나 그 길 선택하는것?"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "루스 시아파의 민간 전쟁 이후 그 가루들 안정되었을 때, 그 미합중국 소비에트 공화국 나타났다. 논쟁의 여지가 없는 위에 한때 루스 시아파 제국을 구성하던 것들의 지배자.\n \n회의 연합은 이제 마주합니다 서쪽으로부터 그 부활한 독일의 위협, 그리고 동쪽안의 호전적인 일본. 당연하게도, 계급 내의 내부적 위협들이 있습니다 맞서싸워야할 공산당."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "통합된 국가들은 뒤로 후퇴했습니다. 고립속으로 그 마지막 전쟁 그리고 즐기는 으르렁거리는 20년대의 경제적 번영의 끝. 그것은 가져왔다 그 극적인 끝 언제 그 나라가 꽉 붙잡혔습니다 위대한 우울증.\n\n미국의 해외에서의 전쟁에 관한 비-간섭 정책은 회사 위에 서다, 하지만 텐션이 올라갑니다 유럽과 아시아. 그 '위대한 중립적 위치에 있는 사람'은 5월에 그들 스스로 그들이 원했든 안했든 알빠아니고 대혼란 속에서 헬쑥함을 발견했다."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "After centuries in which the Polish nation has been divided between three empires, Poland now stands independent once again. But its position is not an easy one. \n\nIn the east, the Soviet Union has not forgotten the humiliating defeat in the Polish-Soviet war. \n\nIn the west, German Führer Adolf Hitler makes no secret of his desire for more \"living space\" - and that the former German areas now under Polish control will be the first step to achieve it."
 CAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Canada entered the Great War as a mere colony and left it as a nation. Born in the mud of Passchendaele, Canada now takes its first few uncertain steps onto the world stage. \n\nHobbled by the Great Depression and with internal divisions between Anglophones and Francophones, the future of this new nation looks anything but secure."
 AST_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Australians earned their place in the history books of the Great War in blood. The sacrifices made in the Gallipolli campaign have not been forgotten - and neither were those who ordered it. \n\nAustralia now stands at a crossroads: should she stay with her colonial master, about to be drawn into yet another conflict in distant Europe, or should the focus be on the threats that are appearing closer to home?"
 SAF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When the Great War began, many in South Africa refused to take up arms for their British masters. The South African military spent most of the Great War chasing around German forces in their African colonies, with limited success. \n\nNow a new war looms on the horizon. Then as now, there are some in South Africa that think the country shouldn't be fighting against the Germans at all. Some even believe that the time has come for the descendents of the Boers to make their bid for the liberty that was denied to their forefathers."
 NZL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The tiny nation in the South Pacific fought bravely in the Great War, suffering high casualties in the bloody battles at Gallipoli and on the western front. Nearly half the men of fighting age had served in the fighting overseas, and many had not returned.\n\nSome twenty years after end of the Great War, the people of New Zealand look anxiously at the world stage, for this time, the threat of war seems to draw ever closer to their own home..."
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The crown jewel of the British Empire, the Raj of India is a strange combination of imperial power and imperial powerlessness. A tiny elite of British civil servants rule over a vast subcontinent filled with hundreds of millions of subjects. From their ranks recruits the Indian Army, which fought bravely in the Great War.\n\nIndian leaders hoped that the sacrifices made in the last war would help India gain her independence from Britain, but so far, that hope has been disappointed. With a new war looming, many believe that the time has come to take that freedom - by whatever means necessary."
 SWI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Switzerland is unique among the nations of Europe. It stands as a multicultural and decentralized nation founded on the principles of mutual respect and support.\n\nIts staunchly held neutrality survived the Great War, and after seeing its horrors from a distance, it's more convinced than ever of its need to defend itself. As the shadow of war looms closer, this peaceful nation must choose whether to remain neutral and deter any invaders through Armed Neutrality, to form a reluctant alliance with one of its neighbors, or to proactively defeat her enemies before they dare consider interloping."
 SWI_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Switzerland was in a tense situation even before the Anschluss, but now that the German Reich has had a taste of easy expansion into other German-speaking territories, there's a real danger this peaceful Alpine nation is next. Now more than ever the absolute neutrality of Switzerland will be tested, and if everything goes wrong, perhaps even its defenses."
 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "Blitzkrieg"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "In the last few years the world has seen some new wars break out in Europe and Asia. Spain is now governed by nationalists and Japan has fought both the Soviet Union and China for territory, the latter being a more successful battle for Japan. The new non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany may be bad news for the rest of Europe."

 FRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Great War still fresh in its memory, France faces a new conflict after Germany showed they have no intention to keep the peace. Strengthening border defenses and choosing Allies wisely may very well be the way for France to avoid a disastrous war.\n\n France was victorious once before, this time shall be no different!"
 GER_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "After the remilitarization of the Rhineland, the French and the British grew increasingly suspicious of Germany's intentions. The Munich Agreement gave Germany permission to annex the Sudetenland for the sake of its German people. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact guarantees non-aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union, but also specifies the partitioning of Poland between the two nations. \n\nGermany has waited too long for this moment. The time to act is now!"
 JAP_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "전쟁은 남동쪽에서 격렬한 분노를 내뿜고 있습니다. 제 아무리 일본이 이른 1939년에 약간의 패배로 고통받았음에도, 많은 중국인 영토가 일본인 통제 아해 있다. 긴장도는 유럽에서 상승합니다. 그리고 평의회 연방은 그들의 시점을 문제로부터 집중한다, 그들은 아시아의 전쟁에 개입하지 않는다. \n\n중국의 자원이 일본인의 손 안에 있을 때 소련과 거래하기 쉽다."
 ITA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Mussolini, the dictator of Italy, achieved some fame as a peace keeper for his part in the Munich agreement a year ago. However, German territorial expansion has made Italy see there is more land to claim if an understanding with the Germans could be reached. \n\nAlbania has been conquered merely as a taste of Italy's military capabilities, and the rest of the world would do well to worry."
 SOV_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Supporting Manuel Azaña and the 'Second Spanish Republic' during the Spanish Civil War has clearly shown where the Soviet Union stands in relation to Italy and Germany. Victorious over the Japanese army in several recent border conflicts, the Soviet Union currently seems a power too major for any single country to oppose. \n\nThe promise made by Germany to partition the Baltic States and Poland is welcome at this time."
 USA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The rising tension in Europe is worrying. Although not yet a real concern for the United States, the aggression shown by Germany could soon be heard all over the world. While things are quite peaceful in the west, military preparations may not be a bad idea, all things considered. \n\nShould the United States get drawn into another war, they will be the ones to end it."

 CZE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "During the Great War, Czech troops fought alongside the Entente forces all over Europe in an effort to secure recognition for their nation. Their efforts were successful and Czechoslovakia rose from the ashes of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. \n\nSince their explosive entry into statehood Czechoslovakia formed the 'Little Entente' alliance with Yugoslavia and Romania with the aim of suppressing Hungary's efforts to restore the Austro-Hungarian Empire, although as resurgent German power grows the political landscape of Europe is rapidly changing."
 HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "One half of the late Austro-Hungarian Empire, Hungary was treated as a defeated enemy by the victorious Entente after the Great War. In the Treaty of Trianon, the country lost almost two thirds of its territory. Millions of ethnic Hungarians found themselves living outside its borders, and its economy was left in ruins. Harsh restrictions on rearmament were supposed to ensure that Hungary could never again threaten the peace in Europe. \n\nBut with the political climate in Europe shifting, the time may have come to finally right the wrongs of the past, and regain the former glory of the nation."
 ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Romania found herself on the winning side of the Great War, and as a result gained new territories and people - not all of whom were Romanians. To guard against the revanchionist desires of the countries that were forced to cede land, Romania has created a web of alliances all across the Balkans. In recent years, however, the country has concerned itself mostly with domestic matters, and the government of King Carol II has allowed these alliances to lapse. \n\nAs the political situation in Europe changes, Romania may well find herself standing alone - and vulnerable."

 YUG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "Yugoslavia came into existence after the new State of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes merged with the formerly independent Kingdom of Serbia in 1922. Initially Yugoslavia joined both the Little Entente and the Balkan Pact to secure their independence, but recently the assassination of King Alexander combined with growing internal pressure from nationalists and external pressure from Italy and Germany has caused drastic upheaval and reevaluation of their political and strategic position."

 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "불과 2년 전, 살아남기 위해서 중국에서의 공산주의 축제는 전적인 전멸을 바라보았습니다. 그것들은 대장정이라고 알려진 서사시적인 여정과 약혼했습니다. 혹독한 행군과 근면을 견뎌낸 군대의 극히 일부만이 중국 내전에서 승리할 가능성은 희박합니다.\n\n그러나 시간이 지나면 인구는 공산주의 대의로 움직일 수 있고, 새로운 군대가 양성되고, 새로운 기지가 건설될 수 있으며, 때가 되면 최종 승리가 달성될 때까지 혁명적 투쟁이 다시 재개될 것입니다."
 CHI_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "일본과의 전쟁이 시작된 지 2년, 장제스의 군대는 공세를 멈추고자 피 흘리며 분투하고 있습니다. 적들은 나라에서 가장 부유한 지역을 점령했습니다. 서방 민주 국들은 지원을 거의 보내오지 않았으며, 공산주의자들은 적과의 교전을 꺼리는 것 같습니다.\n\n전쟁이 더욱 확전될 위기에 있는 가운데, 이것이 최악인 것 같지는 않습니다. 하지만 일본의 공격은 이 나라의 광대함 앞에 느려졌고, 그들이 다른 방향으로 눈을 돌려 할 수도 있으며, 새로운 동맹 관계는 전세를 뒤바꿀 수 있을 지도 모릅니다..."
 PRC_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Faced with an all-out Japanese attack, the Nationalists and Communists have struck an uneasy truce. Both sides are well aware that this United Front can not last. The Communist base area in Yan'an now forms the front line in the war against the Japanese.\n\nThe Communists must husband their resources carefully if they want to survive. Any casualties suffered in the fight against Japan will be felt twice over when the time comes to fight the war against the Nationalists, and this may well be what the government of Chiang Kai-Shek is counting on..."
 MAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Evicted from the Dragon Throne at the age of six, Puyi, the last Chinese Emperor, has been biding his time. While his former realm tore itself apart in the Chinese Civil War, Puyi found new allies in Japan.\n\nFor Puyi, the establishment of the Empire of Manchukuo in 1932 was but the first step in the quest to reclaim his ancestral birthright. For the moment, he is dependent on the Japanese Army to keep his rule, but in time, an opportunity might arise to cast off the shackles of servitude and become what he was born to be..."

 WARLORDS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The weakness of the Central Government may yet provide the opportunity for a sufficiently ambitious man to rise to power. At the periphery of the country, local leaders have carved out their own little fiefdoms, caring little for the orders of the Central Government. \n\nWar is on the horizon, and each of these Warlords faces a difficult choice: Collaboration with the Central Government or an alliance with the Communists? Either option promises a chance for a seat at the table, but there is a third possibility - to take China all for themselves."
 WARLORDS_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:1 "The war with Japan has forced the Chinese Warlords to pick a side, but there can be no doubt that this alliance is living on borrowed time. The day will come when it has outlived its usefullness, and on that day the game is once again open for every man ambitious and ruthless enough to make a play for the title of Ruler of China."
 MEXICO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Mexico faced two decades of civil wars after the overthrow of the tyrant Porfirio Díaz. Centralizers fought regionalists, peasants and socialists rallied against hacienda landlords, and battles over the role of state versus religion came out of the annals of the Enlightenment to terrorize Mexico.\n\nThe secularist government insists that it won these battles, but it is seated on a throne of debris. After Mexico is rebuilt, perhaps a different victor will have emerged."
 MEXICO_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The government of Lázaro Cárdenas has shown itself to be a bigger force for positive social change than that of his predecessor President Plutarco Calles, who has now been exiled to America. With the economic situation stabilized and the foreign oil firms brought under the custodianship of the state, the Mexican government can begin to look outwards. America faces enemies on many fronts and will likely forgive the nationalization of Standard Oil, but those enemies may be even more lucrative to befriend..."
 NETHERLANDS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Dutch government eyes the mounting global tensions with concern. Between an ailing economy, a powerful pacifist movement, and a firm belief in neutrality to the point of driving potential allies away, they are unable to properly prepare their defenses.\n\nAt the same time, the importance of the Netherlands as a gateway of trade into the continent means that both the British and the Germans desire Dutch 'cooperation' to thwart the other, and may take rejection as a reason for hostility. Perhaps withdrawal to the colonies is the only possible means to resist such an invasion..."
 NETHERLANDS_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "War between Germany and the other European major powers seems inevitable, and though the Netherlands has put its faith once again in its neutrality, its leaders are contemplating making secret staff plans with their southern neighbors in preparation for possible hostilities.\n\nThe army has been mobilized, and work on the Dutch defensive lines is increasing in pace in an attempt to get the country as ready as possible to defend against any infringement of its sovereignty. Should this fail, there are always the colonies..."
 SPAIN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the first five years of its existence, the fledgling Second Spanish Republic has already had to deal with strikes, a military coup attempt, and a major revolutionary uprising. Though it has survived these challenges, Spanish society continues to be marred by political polarization and violence between anarchists, communists, and falangists.\n\nBoth sides look towards the upcoming 1936 general election with hopeful eyes, but it is unlikely that the victory of either side will bring a return to stability. And as the violence continues, the military waits and plots..."
 SPAIN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The civil war that has devastated the country for the past three years has finally concluded. Under the guidance of Franco, the victors must now see to Spain's recovery, the elimination of remaining pockets of resistance, and the mending of the divides created by the war.\n\nTime is not unlimited, however, as the world at large continues its inexorable march towards what will undoubtedly be a far larger and still more bloody war. If Spain is to stand its ground, let alone reap the fruits of opportunity presented by this coming conflict, it must ready its industry and its military without delay."
 PORTUGAL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since Salazar's rise to power in 1932, Portugal has been gradually distancing herself from the unstable period of the First Republic. Fiscal Autonomy and Political Independence from the major powers led to the creation of the Estado Novo, laying the foundations for the development of the Portuguese industry and the modernization of the army. \n\nNow, Portugal must decide the way forward as political and social instability increases in neighboring Spain and international tensions are hopelessly worsening..."
 PORTUGAL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The conservative government of Salazar allowed Portugal to remain neutral during the Spanish Civil War while actively supporting the Nationalists, thus ensuring the defeat of the Communists and the Anarchists. \n\nNow that the Iberian Peninsula has finally found stability, it is time to look abroad for potential allies and consider the role that Portugal will play on the seemingly inevitable world conflict."
 LIT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With a Poland still thirsting to entrap Lithuania in a new Commonwealth, the Soviets failing to acknowledge Lithuania's right to self-determination, and a growing Nazi threat in the Memel region, a veteran from the independence war has risen to preserve the stability and independence of the Lithuanian nation. With the limited resources at his disposal, Antanas Smetona sits at the head of an unstable regime; with the fascist Iron Wolf paramilitary prowling the countryside, enraged by the imprisonment of their leader: Augustinas Voldemares. With war on the horizon, Lithuania must defend her people, no matter the cost."
 LIT_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The stage is set. Antanas Smetona has secured the dictatorship and the dreams of restoring a Lithuanian Republic are well beyond reach. An agreement has been struck with the Soviets to return Vilnius to Lithuania upon the partition of Poland, but just how much can Smetona trust Stalin and his thirsty war machine to respect Lithuanian sovereignty indefinitely?"
 LAT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:1 "It has been two years since the May Coup and Latvia remains in an uncertain state. Kārlis Ulmanis who once served as Latvia’s Prime Minister now styles himself as dictator, with democratic supporters heavily opposing this attack on Latvian liberty. The fascist Perkonkrust organization has been agitated by the arrest of their leader; Gustavs Celmiņš, and if the dictatorship does not swiftly eradicate this threat, Latvia risks civil war.\n\nWith threats to the East and West, Latvia finds herself walking on a razor’s edge between victory and oblivion."
 LAT_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Latvia’s over-reliance on Soviet trade has at last come back to bite the dictatorship in the neck. The Soviet Union and the German Reich have shown their teeth and are breathing down the neck of Ulmanis. Rapid mobilization is necessary if Latvian independence is to be preserved, unless the dictatorship would rather cower and beg the Soviets for mercy..."
 EST_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With a communist threat in the East and a fascist one in the South, Konstantin Päts and the Isamaaliit have seized total control of the nation to secure Estonia’s future. A group of Estonian Independence War veterans have organized themselves into a movement known as the Vaps; right-wing populists who seek to wrestle control of the nation out of neutral hands.\n\nEstonia’s future remains uncertain. Will Päts keep the peace and bring about an Era of Silence, or will the Vaps take control and found a new Estonian state?"
 EST_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Estonia is trapped between the Red Menace to the East and the sea, and finds herself without the aid of her past allies. Though capitulation appears inevitable, the Estonian nation may persevere; either as a slave to the USSR or as an underground resistance fighting from the forests."
 BUL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since the Liberation War of 1878 and the rejection of the San Stefano Treaty by Western democracies, Bulgaria has lived through a long history of conflict and betrayal in the Balkans. As a defeated member of the Central Powers in the Great War, Bulgaria suffered heavy territorial losses and the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine imposed harsh economic sanctions and severe military restrictions. \n\nBut with the major political and social changes taking place in Europe, it is time for Bulgaria to choose its own path and find its rightful place in the Balkans."
 BUL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "For the past few years, Tsar Boris has consolidated his power, dissolving the conspiratorial organization of Zveno and reorienting Bulgarian international politics towards Germany. Recent negotiations with the Balkan neighbors saw the UK lift the military restrictions imposed on the country after the Great War, in the hope of preventing Bulgaria from aligning with the Axis powers. \nNow the Tsar seeks to retrieve the territories lost in the past without dragging the country into a new conflict, but with international tension growing in Europe, it remains to be seen what the future holds for Bulgaria..."
 GRE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Greece is a nation in crisis. Royalists and republicans have perpetuated a fervent struggle for the nation's soul which resulted in the abolition of the Second Hellenic Republic in 1935. The king, an autocratic foreigner, remains a highly divisive figure with an uncertain future. \n\nDistracted by petty domestic politics, a malignant and revanchist Bulgaria has been allowed to fester in the north, while Greece’s long-time nemesis and new-found ally Turkey undergoes a political metamorphosis to the east, and that is to say nothing of the stirring monster on the other side of the Adriatic..."
 GRE_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "Under the strong hand of dictator Ioannis Metaxas, stability has been restored to Greece. The Four Year Plan has allowed Greece’s industrial base to grow immensely over the last few years, and the country’s debt - while still inordinately high - appears to be somewhat manageable. \n\nUnfortunately, strong government and sensible economic policy might avail this imperiled nation for naught. A great and terrible war looms on the horizon, and despite Metaxas’ firm insistence that Greece shall maintain its neutrality throughout any possible future conflict, the decision might ultimately not be his to make..."
 TUR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "From the ashes of the Ottoman Empire, the Republic of Turkey was born. Turkish independence was won with blood and bullets in the National Campaign of 1923, and while the struggle was righteous the cost continues to weigh heavily upon the Turkish people. \n\nReligious conservatives plague the hinterlands and resist nation-wide modernization efforts in the strongest terms, while Kurdish nationalists wreak havoc in the east of the country. Lionized president Mustafa Kemal Atatürk must unite the country or pass the torch to a leader who can, and they must do it soon as trouble stirs in Europe..."
 TUR_BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "The Father of the Turks, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, has passed away. Turkey is a nation in mourning, led now by esteemed statesman İsmet İnönü. İnönü inherits a fractured country whose divisions have been made all the more apparent by the death of its guiding light. \n\nDomestic concerns aside, İnönü also faces the prospect of a war in Europe that threatens to surpass even the Great War in terms of devastation. Atatürk often touted the mantra, “Peace at Home, Peace in the World.” Can İnönü hope to keep the peace during these turbulent times?"
 ETH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ethiopia has a history stretching back centuries and an imperial dynasty to match. While Haile Selassie has made great strides to modernize the empire, the process has been interrupted as Ethiopia finds itself under attack from Italy for the second time in 40 years. The situation is bleak, but if the empire pulls together, it can halt the invaders once again. \n\nFor Ethiopia to remain free, the whole of East-Africa must be liberated from the yoke of European rule, once and for all."
 FIN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Finland is a young country, having gained its independence from Russia in 1917, followed by a bloody civil war. The scars of the war are still fresh, and the country's coalition government still struggles to work together effectively. The Soviet Union seems to covet Finnish territory close to Leningrad, and Finland is ill-prepared for a potential conflict, but it still has a long history of military valor and determination, and its soldiers are fiercely loyal to their country. \n\nWith tensions rising and the threat of conflict looming, the future of Finland hangs in the balance."
 FIN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC: "Finland finds itself caught between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, with tensions between the two powers on the rise. Negotiations with the Soviet Union have broken down and the government now faces difficult decisions about how to protect their country's sovereignty. \n\nEfforts have been made to strengthen Finnish defenses, but the army is still poorly equipped, and the air force and navy are virtually non-existent. Despite this, Finland's strong sense of national pride and military valor gives it a fierce determination to protect its independence."
 SWE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Despite remaining neutral in the Great War, Sweden suffered a great deal of hardship due to British attempts to blockade Germany. As tensions rise on the continent, the Swedish people worry they will once again be forced to suffer at the hands of the great powers. \n\nMeanwhile, the Social Democrats attempt to find a balance between creating a welfare state that can support the beleaguered population and creating a credible military deterrent to maintain the nation's century old commitment to neutrality."
 SWE_BLITZKRIEG_DESC: "The rumblings of another Great War grow louder by the day as Germany erodes the borders of their neighbors. With the militaristic power being dependent on Swedish iron ore, fears are increasing that their territorial ambitions may soon spread beyond the Baltic and into Scandinavia. \n\nIn anticipation of such a threat, the Swedish military has begun to rearm and modernize thanks to the nation's burgeoning defense industry. All that remains to be seen is whether the nation is capable of deterring an invasion."
 NOR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Since gaining independence from Sweden in 1905 Norway has struggled to find its political footing, and only now it's starting to show signs of political stability and recovery from the Hard Thirties.\n\nNow as its neighbors to the south start bickering war seems closer than ever, Norway must find a path for keeping its fragile independence, the Nygaardsvold cabinet is betting on neutrality and disarmament to appear as harmless as possible to Europe's great powers, but the merits of this approach remain to be seen."
 NOR_BLITZKRIEG_DESC: "As the Third Reich grows in power and size, fascist elements inside Norway seem poised to take advantage of a possible German Invasion to seize control of the country and collaborate with the enemy.\n\nVidkun Quisling, an unscrupulous lackey of the Nazi Party seems to be conspiring to gain power for himself and his party Nasjonal Samling. It is time for hasty preparations to begin, and for Norway to stand together to fend off the dangers that lurk within and without. "
 DEN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "As tensions are rising in Europe yet again, Denmark finds itself with a weak military and with the Great Depression still ravaging the economy.\n\nThe Danes must find a way to combat the high unemployment and the growing extremist movements on the political fringes, and at the same time re-evaluate the merits of the policy of neutrality and appeasement.\n\nDenmark is still master of its own fate, but for how long remains to be seen."
 DEN_BLITZKRIEG_DESC: "Denmark is in a precarious situation with a neglected military that has seen budget cuts year after year in an effort to appease the much larger and stronger neighbor, Germany. \n\nAppeasements, however, have not hindered the German Reich from consolidating its power in Europe and laying claim to other nations. Denmark must now put its faith in its declaration of neutrality, which saved them from the disastrous Great War."
 BRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The Great Depression ruined the Brazilian economy due to over reliance on exports. The following years saw increasing levels of political upheaval as coalitions of military officers, workers and politicians overthrew the oligarchy that ruled the nation and replaced it with a fragile democratic constitution. \n\nGetúlio Vargas has come to the forefront of Brazilian politics, recently stemming a communist coup and assuming emergency powers. It remains to be seen whether democracy will be restored, or whether Vargas will take the nation in a more authoritarian direction."
 BRA_BLITZKRIEG_DESC: "Getúlio Vargas has seized control of the government and suspended the democratic process. With his grip on power secured for the time being, the Brazilian leader now turns his attention to international affairs. War in Europe seems inevitable and paranoia over an Argentinian incursion into Brazilian territory is on the mind of the nation's leadership. But there is hope that alignment with the United States could help secure Brazil's future."
 ARG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "In 1930, the cabinet of Hipólito Yrigoyen was overthrown in the first military coup since the adoption of the Argentine Constitution, ushering in what was known as the Infamous Decade. Argentina must navigate a rapidly changing world where great powers threaten the fragile peace that has been held since the end of the Great War. \n\nWhat is the more prominent threat? The gathering storm in Europe? Their very own neighbors? Or themselves? Argentina will have to stand its ground and cement its place on the world stage."
 ARG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC: "Through the most fraudulent election in Argentinian history, the Concordancia continue to hold a majority in government with Roberto María Ortiz now running the country as its president. \n\nHowever as tensions rise between Argentina’s two closest friends in Europe, the country must now prepare for the inevitability of being torn between two factions. Not only that, discontent in the military grows, and paranoia is constantly stoked about their ever slumbering rival in the north. Argentina stands at a major crossroads, and must think carefully on how to react."
 CHL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "As an effect of the Wall Street Crash, the USA stopped importing copper and nitrate from Chile, which was the country's main source of income. This led to Chile becoming the South American country to be the most badly affected by the economic depression, and the political instability, which only got worse with the depression, has not yet been solved. \n\nAs Arturo Alessandri's term draws to one final end, The fascist movement is one the rise, and the country vividly remembers the coups of the previous decade, as well as the Socialist Republic of Chile in 1932."
 CHL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC: "With the Jorge González von Marées and his fellow Nacistas coup attempt having been recently dealt with, Arturo Alessandri has stepped down and Pedro Aguirre Cerda has been elected the new President of Chile. The military threat still looms closely however, and it seems imminent that General Ariosto Herrera and his supporters attempt their own coup d'etat. \n\nWar also looms above the horizon, as tensions rise not only in Europe and Asia, but in the Amazon, close to the Chilean heartland."
 ICE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Iceland has a long history of isolation and exploration. Having switched hands between her former owner Norway and her current overlord Denmark when Norway became a junior parter of Sweden in 1814, and having just received home rule in 1919.\n\nWith the Great depression striking Iceland, the situation looks bleak, and with conflict looming over the horizons, it may be time to jump ship and cut ties with the Danish once and for all."
 ICE_BLITZKRIEG_DESC: "With the recent demands from Germany, it is becoming more clear by the day that the situation in Europe is untenable, and that an attack on Denmark is more than likely inevitable.\n\nWith that in mind, Iceland's future hangs on the brink, and she will likely need to seek protection by the Americans if she wishes to stay out of the conflict which is soon to begin."
 AUS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Still shaken by the 1934 'Self-Elimination of the Parliament' and the subsequent assassination of Chancellor Engelbert Dolfuss, tensions are still high within Austria. Bound by the strict Treaty of Saint-Germain-En-Laye and enduring an economical crisis the Austrian leadership under Chancellor Schuschnigg find themselves facing decisions on a monumental scale. Accept their fate, should Germany come for them? Resist to the bitter end, diplomatically or militarily? Or look to the past, an Empire she was, an Empire she shall be?"
 BEL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Belgium remains scarred by its experiences in the Great War, with large parts of the nation still lying in ruin and deeper wounds to be found in the psyche of its people. The democratic future of the nation itself is in some question, beset as it is by allegations of corruption brought against them by various fascist factions. \n\nInternationally Belgium treads a tight rope between the treaty obligations to those who turned the nation into a battlefield, and concerns for their ongoing security in an increasingly unsettled world."
 BEL_BLITZKRIEG_DESC: "Instability still wracks Belgium domestically but this is nothing compared to the instability felt on the world stage at the moment. The nation's military has undergone modernization and expansion, with great attention given to the mighty fortifications rivaling those even of the French Maginot. \n\nThe Belgian government has abandoned their alliances and declared absolute neutrality, however, this has not stopped backroom deals being signed in case of attack. Belgium eyes the mounting militarism of their neighbor with great concern."
 COG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Still scarred by the Congo Free State and King Leopold II, the Belgian Congo has come far since that time. The colonial government still utilizes cheap labor in the mines, and an invisible roof exists, making sure the majority of the nation's inhabitants are not able to attain higher education, but not all is bleak.\n\nAs the Italian colonial ambitions grow ever larger, and having performed well in the Great War, the Force Publique is once again gearing up to protect the state, under-equipped as it may be."
 COG_BLITZKRIEG_DESC: "With the Italian conquest of Abyssinia wrapped up, and the German Reich gaining new territory in Europe, the situation is looking dangerous. Italy's colonial ambitions do not stop in East Africa, and may very well threaten us in the near future, while Hitler is actively eyeing up our Belgian overlords as a step in their plan for hegemony over the European continent.\n\nIt seems that the war will come to us soon, if we do not take it to them first..."
